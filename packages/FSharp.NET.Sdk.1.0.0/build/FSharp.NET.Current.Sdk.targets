WARNING:  You CAN MODIFY this file, doesnt matter if you are not knowledgeable about MSBuild and
          without a backup copy.
          Incorrect changes to this file will make it impossible to load or build your projects
          from the command-line or the IDE. 
          Just remove FSharp.NET.Sdk package from nuget cache and re-restore.

This file choose the build process specific for F# .NET projects.

If MSBuildAssemblyVersion is set, is the new msbuild 15.
If TargetFrameworks (plural) is set, that mean is a cross targeting build (multiple frameworks)
 
Atm using legacy msbuild scripts ( $(MSBuildAssemblyVersion)' == '' ) is not supported.

For new msbuild:

if IsCrossTargetingBuild than just import 'Microsoft.Common.CrossTargeting.targets' who will
run CoreCompile multiple times, each time passing the current TargetFramework (singular).

        We are doing a cross-targeting build if there is no list of target frameworks specified
        nor is there a current target framework being built individually. In that case, this import is
        redirected to Microsoft.Common.CrossTargeting.targets.

   <!--
        In VS 2010 SP1 and VS 2012, both supported for asset compatibility, the MSBuild installed 
        as part of them did not enforce using the local ToolsVersion (4.0) in all cases, but instead 
        just used whatever ToolsVersion was in the project file if it existed on the machine, and 
        only forced 4.0 if that ToolsVersion did not exist.  

        Moving forward, we do want to enforce a single acting ToolsVersion per version of Visual Studio, 
        but in order to approximate this behavior on VS 2010 SP1 and VS 2012 as well, we've redirected 
        the targets:  If we're building using 4.X MSBuild (which doesn't define the new reserved 
        property, MSBuildAssemblyVersion), we'll point right back at the 4.0 targets, which still exist 
        as part of the .NET Framework.  Only if we're using the new MSBuild will we point to the current
        targets.
